Create a TypeScript configuration file

(-- ) is a flag that is passed to the TypeScript compiler. It is not a flag for the yarn tsc command.

```
yarn tsc -- --init
```

and modify with your requirements for development.

Run the TypeScript compiler

```
yarn tsc
```

This creates a dist folder with the compiled JavaScript files.

`./build`
